I revisted exercise 15 and 16 where I learned to teach the PC to read and write a file.
In addition to that I attempted to help many other people to catch up on their own leanrning. I believe when everyone else is update on where they are trying to go we will spend less class time on troubleshooting none coding things. We can help each other with coding not how to install ruby or how to install some other software.
