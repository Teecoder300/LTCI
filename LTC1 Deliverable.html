<h4>Growth X Meet-Up</h4>
<p>I went to a seminar that instructed none tech people on how to move into the tech industry. They helped us understand what our core values were; what is important to me and what I am passionate about. That will helped I and others find out which companies align with our passions. 
We then learned how to evaluate a companyâ€™s, start-up or fortune 500, business plan. This would give us an advantage to tell those in management and hiring position what we add of value to their company. By knowing how the company works we can elaborate on how we can help them achieve such goals. 
They also provided a 12 week day by day system that is a template to follow on how research and gain a new career path. The 3 main career paths that they offer information on are UX, Sales, and product development. Having a template and networking was very useful.
